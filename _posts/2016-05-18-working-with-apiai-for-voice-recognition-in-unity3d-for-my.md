description: 'Working with API.ai for voice recognition in Unity3D for my first AR project was a good experience. We integrated voice recognition because interacting with technology should be a natural experience and people should not have to rely on a keyboard and mouse all the time. The keyboard and mouse are awkward input devices, although great in their time. We now have the ability to offer a much more immersive experiences by utilizing the most natural methods of input to increase our comfort and productivity.'

Contributing to the [Torch ][0]project by implementing Mac support for Facebook's [TH++][1], a C++ tensor library implemented as a wrapper around the TH library ((the low-level tensor library in Torch).

I am currently building a C++ program that listens to a user's keystrokes and learns how they write. The predictive model will eventually learn different contexts (applications) and a user's preferred language or writing style in that context. Once the model has a high percentage of confidence in what the user will type in the current context, it will suggest the most likely options for the user to choose from.

Some potential use cases are autocomplete programming, documentation, research reports, chats, searches, note taking... What are some possibilities you can imagine? I will make this open source as soon as there is something worthwhile. Have suggestions, want to be notified once it is publicly available, want to contribute? email me! tylerlindell@gmail.com

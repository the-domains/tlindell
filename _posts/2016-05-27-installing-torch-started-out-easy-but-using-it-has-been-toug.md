Installing Torch started out easy but using it has been tough! Not because the language is challenging or the stuff I am working on is hard - Making sure the right packages I need are installed has been the biggest hurdle. This may not be something that effects everyone but I have gone through the ringer with various dependencies not working correctly or not being installed. From there I investigate what the issue could be and where I can repair my happy-path. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e6fa8376-69e9-438e-954c-2bed0fcc0c49.png)

The struggle today has been ipython, "is it installed? If so, where is it installed? Oh! It is not installed, let's install it! WON'T INSTALL!? Okay, why not? Let's fix that! Everything is finally installed! \*\*runs commands\*\* Not recognized!? O\_0". That has been the grief for today, but without issues like these... Programming would be boring!

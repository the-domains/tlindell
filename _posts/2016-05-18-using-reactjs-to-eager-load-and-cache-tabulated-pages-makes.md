Using React.js to eager load and cache tabulated pages makes information available to users immediately. I chose React for it's speed and simplicity. Multiple ajax calls being active at the same time, data being returned after various lengths of time, then cached once each returned - React made it simpler and faster.

Keeping elements and JavaScript in the same calls seemed a little weird at first but I soon gained appreciation for how easy it was to match code to elements without flipping back and forth between files to make sure the two would work well together. This can also help later on when I need to update elements because I can do so and update the JavaScript associated with those elements nearly eliminating the out-of-sync JS file and HTML file.
